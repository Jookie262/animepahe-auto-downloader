# **Animepahe Auto Downloader** 📥
I have created a selenium-based Python project to automate the process of downloading anime from the Animepahe website. As an anime fan, I enjoy downloading my favorite shows and Animepahe is a fantastic source for both streaming and downloading anime, as they always compress the videos for better accessibility. While the project still has some bugs and is not the most efficient method, it does serve its purpose and makes downloading anime easier for me.
